`geckor` is an R client for the public [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api#explore-api). This package implements several endpoints offered by that API, allowing users to collect the
current and historical market data on over 8000 cryptocurrencies from more than 300 exchanges. Results are returned in a tabular form (as [tibbles](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/)), ready for any downstream analyses.

## Installation

At the moment, `geckor` is only available on GitHub and can be installed with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("next-game-solutions/geckor")

library(geckor)
```

## Examples

Detailed examples of how to use `geckor` can be found in its [online documentation](https://next-game-solutions.github.io/geckor/). Provided below are just a few common queries:

```{r load-geckor}
library(geckor)

# check if the CoinGecko service is available:
ping()
```


```{r example, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width=10, fig.height=4.5}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Get the current price of Cardano, Tron, and Polkadot,
# expressed in USD, EUR, and GBP:
current_price(coin_ids = c("cardano", "tron", "polkadot"),
              vs_currencies = c("usd", "eur", "gbp"))

# Get a more comprehensive view of the current Cardano, Tron, and 
# Polkadot markets:
current_market(coin_ids = c("cardano", "tron", "polkadot"), 
               vs_currency = "usd") %>% 
  glimpse()

# Collect all historical data on the price of Cardano (expressed in EUR),
# and plot the result:
cardano_history <- coin_history(coin_id = "cardano", 
                                vs_currency = "eur", 
                                days = "max")

cardano_history %>% 
  ggplot(aes(timestamp, price)) +
  geom_line() + theme_minimal()
```


## API rate limit

The public [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentations/v3) offers a rate limit of 50 calls per minute. Please keep this limit in mind when developing your applications using the `geckor` package.
